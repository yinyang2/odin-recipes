        <h2>Description</h2>   
        <p>The best Banana Bread. Lots of Banana and a hint of almond and almond liqueur to make a
            delicious afternoon snack with butter and tea.</p>
            
           <p> The prep time to make this is around 15 minutes, and the cook time around 1 hour. In total you
            can enjoy this wonderful bread in less than 2 hours. The yield of this would be around 1 bread
            serving a group of 8 at a time! </p>
